Description:
Numbers of species on 42 British Isles, Area, Elevation, # of soil types,
latitude, and distance from Britain.
Authors fit: linear, log transformed, and "mixed" models (presumably
adding small distance to Britain for the isle of Britain.

Model 1: No variables transformed
Model 2: All variables transformed
Model 3: Only Area log transformed
Model 4: Species and # soil types not transformed, all others log transformed
Model 5: S not transformed, all IV's and their log transfromed
Model 6: S and A log transformed, none of others transformed
Model 7: All variables transformed except # soil types
